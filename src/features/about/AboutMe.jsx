        <p>
          I grew up in Anchorage, Alaska and studied classical guitar
          performance and music education at the University of Alaska Anchorage.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had been teaching music for over a decade when the coronavirus
          began, and since I wasn&apos;t teaching much due to the pandemic, I
          decided to try something I&apos;d always wanted to do, and that&apos;s
          work for a gaming company.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my time there, I discovered I really enjoyed coding, and I&apos;ve
          essentially been consuming everything I can on the topic since then.
