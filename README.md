Welcome to my portfolio site!

Built using React, this is intended to showcase some of my skill in building a user-friendly interface. This is a mobile and desktop friendly site with a custom pixel art animation I made from scratch to show the transition between dark and light mode.

I have other projects listed in the project section as well as a list of skills and contact info.
